## Session Objective
Create a detailed, iterative MVP technical plan that can be executed through sprints.

## Iterative Planning Process

### CRITICAL RULE: ASK, DON'T ASSUME
- If any specialist lacks information to make technical decisions, they MUST ask clarifying questions
- Never assume requirements, user flows, data sources, or technical constraints
- Each specialist should identify what they need to know before proceeding
- Continue iterating until all specialists have sufficient detail to create actionable plans

### Phase 1: Requirements Clarification (All Specialists)
Each specialist analyzes the project idea and identifies what they need to know:

**Solution Architect needs to understand:**
- Core system requirements and user workflows
- Performance and scalability expectations
- Integration requirements with external systems
- Security and compliance requirements

**Data Engineering Specialist needs to understand:**
- Data sources (internal/external, APIs, files, databases)
- Data volumes, velocity, and variety
- Real-time vs batch processing requirements
- Data retention, backup, and compliance needs

**Frontend Technical Lead needs to understand:**
- Target users and their devices/browsers
- User interface complexity and interactivity requirements
- Real-time update needs
- Offline capabilities and performance requirements

**Backend Technical Lead needs to understand:**
- API requirements and external integrations
- Expected load and concurrent users
- Third-party service dependencies
- Deployment environment and infrastructure constraints

### Phase 2: Iterative Technical Design
Based on clarified requirements, specialists collaborate to design:

1. **System Architecture**: Component design and communication patterns
2. **Data Architecture**: Storage, processing, and flow design
3. **API Design**: Endpoints, data models, and integration patterns
4. **Technology Stack**: Frameworks, databases, and tools selection
5. **Infrastructure Design**: Hosting, scaling, and deployment architecture

### Phase 3: Detailed Sprint Planning
Create actionable development plan with:

1. **Epic Breakdown**: Major system components and features
2. **Story Mapping**: Detailed technical stories with clear acceptance criteria
3. **Sprint Structure**: 2-week sprints with dependencies and prerequisites
4. **Technical Tasks**: Specific implementation tasks for each story
5. **Definition of Done**: Clear completion criteria for each deliverable

## Output Requirements

Provide a comprehensive MVP technical plan including:

### 1. System Architecture Document
- High-level system component diagram (ASCII/text format)
- Data flow architecture and communication patterns
- Technology stack with technical justification
- Infrastructure and deployment architecture

### 2. Epic & Story Breakdown
For each epic, provide:
- Epic name and technical scope
- Technical complexity and implementation approach
- Component dependencies and prerequisites
- Success criteria and testing requirements

### 3. Detailed Sprint Plan
**Sprint 0: Foundation & Infrastructure**
- Development environment setup
- Core infrastructure provisioning
- CI/CD pipeline establishment
- Basic project structure and tooling

**Sprint 1-N: Feature Development Sprints**
Each sprint should include:
- Sprint technical goal and deliverables
- User stories with technical acceptance criteria
- Story point estimates and complexity notes
- Technical tasks breakdown for each story
- Definition of done with testing requirements
- Dependencies and blockers

### 4. Technical User Stories
For each story, provide:
- Technical story format: "As a [developer/system], I need [technical capability] so that [system behavior]"
- Detailed acceptance criteria with technical specifications
- Story point estimation (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- Technical implementation notes
- Testing requirements (unit, integration, e2e)
- Dependencies on other stories or external systems

### 5. Data Architecture Specification
- Database schema design with relationships
- Data processing pipelines and ETL workflows
- API data models and validation rules
- Data storage and retrieval patterns
- Backup, archival, and data governance

### 6. API Specification
- REST/GraphQL endpoint definitions
- Request/response data models
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Rate limiting and caching strategies
- Error handling and validation

### 7. Frontend Architecture
- Component hierarchy and state management
- Routing and navigation patterns
- API integration and data fetching
- Real-time update mechanisms
- Performance optimization strategies

### 8. DevOps & Infrastructure Plan
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Deployment pipeline and automation
- Monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Security implementation and compliance
- Disaster recovery and backup procedures

## Technical Standards Integration

Ensure all plans incorporate:

**Agile Development Practices**
- 2-week sprint cycles with clear deliverables
- Story pointing using Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- Definition of done for each story and sprint
- Sprint retrospectives and continuous improvement

**Software Engineering Best Practices**
- Test-driven development (TDD) with unit test coverage
- Code review processes and quality gates
- Comprehensive documentation for APIs and components
- Performance testing and optimization
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment

**DevOps & Infrastructure Standards**
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) practices
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with testing gates
- Container-based deployment strategies
- Monitoring, observability, and alerting
- Automated backup and disaster recovery

**Data Engineering Standards**
- Data validation and quality assurance
- ETL pipeline monitoring and error handling
- Data lineage and governance tracking
- Privacy compliance and data protection
- Scalable data processing architecture

## Iteration Protocol

1. **Initial Analysis**: Each specialist reviews the project idea and identifies critical unknowns
2. **Question Round**: Specialists ask specific clarifying questions (DO NOT ASSUME ANYTHING)
3. **CEO Response**: Wait for clarification from the CEO
4. **Refinement**: Specialists update their analysis based on new information
5. **Integration**: Specialists collaborate to resolve cross-functional dependencies
6. **Validation**: Present current understanding and ask for final clarifications
7. **Finalization**: Create detailed sprint plan only when all requirements are clear

## Specialist Interaction Style

Each specialist should:
- Ask specific, technical questions about their domain
- Identify dependencies on other specialists' work
- Propose technical solutions with clear rationale
- Challenge technical assumptions constructively
- Focus on implementable, testable solutions

**The Solution Architect** moderates technical discussions and ensures system coherence.

## Expected Output Format

Structure the final MVP plan as a detailed technical specification document that a development team can use to immediately begin Sprint 0. Include specific technical tasks, clear acceptance criteria, and realistic story point estimates.

**Begin by having each specialist analyze the project idea and ask their clarifying questions. Do not proceed with detailed planning until all specialists have sufficient information.**
