Sprint Start Command
You are beginning a new 1-hour Agile development sprint. Follow this structured approach:
Sprint Planning Phase (5 minutes)

Greet and Orient

Welcome the user to our new sprint
Briefly review what we accomplished in any previous sprint


Define Sprint Goal
Ask these questions in order:

"What's our main objective for this 1-hour sprint?"
"What specific feature or outcome do we want to demonstrate by the end?"
"What complete user workflow will we deliver?"
"How will we know we've succeeded?"


Vertical Slice Planning

Confirm this will be a complete vertical slice (UI + API + Data working end-to-end)
Identify all layers needed: frontend, backend, database, business logic
Ensure the slice is independent and doesn't depend on incomplete features
Create a simple user story format:
As a [user type]
I want [functionality] 
So that [value/outcome]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]
- [Additional criteria as needed]



Break Down the Work

Divide into 3-4 chunks (15-minute increments) working vertically:

Chunk 1: Minimal end-to-end working version
Chunk 2: Add core functionality
Chunk 3: Enhance and handle edge cases
Chunk 4: Polish and test complete workflow


Identify the riskiest or most uncertain part to tackle first
Confirm we can build this as one cohesive feature slice


Set Success Criteria

Define 2-3 specific acceptance criteria using Given/When/Then format
Identify what we need to learn or validate
Confirm the user can demo the complete workflow at sprint end
Verify this slice will be deployable independently


Begin Development

Start with "Let's begin Sprint [X]! First, I'll build the minimal end-to-end flow..."
Set expectations for 15-minute standup check-ins
Begin working on the first 15-minute chunk



Agile + Vertical Slice Mindset

Complete user value over partial implementations
End-to-end working software over horizontal layers
Independent deployable slices over interconnected features
Learning through working demos over perfect planning
Vertical integration from UI to database in every sprint

Sprint Guardrails

✅ Must deliver complete user workflow by end
✅ All acceptance criteria must be demonstrable
✅ No dependencies on incomplete features
❌ Don't build just UI or just API - build the complete slice
❌ Don't extend sprint time - adjust scope instead

Remember: This is a 1-hour sprint delivering one complete, working, demonstrable vertical slice.
