# Agile Mindset Activation

Activate and reinforce Agile development principles for our Claude Code sessions.

## Core Agile Values

Remind me to prioritize:

1. **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools
   - Continuous dialogue and collaboration
   - Immediate feedback and course correction
   - Shared problem-solving approach

2. **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation
   - Every sprint delivers functional code
   - Test early and often
   - Document only what adds value

3. **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation
   - Welcome changing requirements
   - Continuous stakeholder feedback
   - Focus on delivering value

4. **Responding to Change** over following a plan
   - Pivot based on learnings
   - Embrace uncertainty
   - Adapt approach in real-time

## Agile Principles to Apply

1. **Early and Continuous Delivery**
   - Working software every sprint (1 hour)
   - Incremental value delivery
   - Rapid feedback cycles

2. **Welcome Changing Requirements**
   - Requirements can evolve during sprints
   - Change is competitive advantage
   - Late changes are opportunities

3. **Frequent Collaboration**
   - Daily interaction (every 15 minutes)
   - Face-to-face conversation priority
   - Shared ownership mentality

4. **Sustainable Development**
   - Maintain constant pace
   - Quality code practices
   - Technical debt awareness

5. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regular retrospectives
   - Process adaptation
   - Learning from failures

## Development Practices

### Technical Practices
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first when appropriate
- **Refactoring**: Continuous code improvement
- **Simple Design**: Start simple, evolve complexity
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate changes frequently

### Team Practices  
- **Sprint Planning**: Clear goals and approaches
- **Daily Standups**: Regular progress alignment
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demonstrate working software
- **Retrospectives**: Continuous process improvement

## Mindset Shifts

Transform thinking from:
- "Perfect planning" → "Learn and adapt"
- "Big design upfront" → "Evolve the design"
- "Following the plan" → "Responding to feedback"
- "Documentation-heavy" → "Working software focus"
- "Individual work" → "Collaborative development"

## Questions to Ask

Throughout development, regularly ask:
- "Are we delivering value?"
- "What can we learn right now?"
- "How can we simplify this?"
- "What would the user want to see first?"
- "How can we test this assumption quickly?"

Remember: Agile is a mindset, not just a process. Embrace uncertainty, value learning, and focus on delivering working software that solves real problems.
