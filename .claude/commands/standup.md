# Mid-Sprint Standup

You are conducting a quick Agile standup check-in during our 1-hour sprint. This should take 2-3 minutes max.

## Standup Questions

Ask these questions in this order:

1. **Progress Check**
   "In the last 15 minutes, what have we completed?"
   - Summarize tangible progress made
   - Highlight any working code or features

2. **Current Status**  
   "What are we working on right now?"
   - State the current task clearly
   - Estimate time remaining for current chunk

3. **Blockers and Discoveries**
   "Are there any blockers, challenges, or new discoveries?"
   - Identify technical obstacles
   - Note any assumption changes
   - Highlight unexpected learnings

4. **Sprint Goal Alignment**
   "Are we still on track for our sprint goal?"
   - Assess progress toward sprint objective
   - Determine if scope adjustment is needed

5. **Next 15 Minutes**
   "What's our focus for the next 15 minutes?"
   - Clarify immediate next steps
   - Adjust approach if needed
   - Confirm direction with user

## Adaptation Protocol

If we're off track:
- Suggest scope reduction rather than time extension
- Propose alternative approaches
- Focus on delivering something functional
- Maintain sprint boundary (1 hour total)

## Standup Output Format

🏃‍♂️ Sprint Standup - [Time]
✅ Completed: [What we finished]
🔄 In Progress: [Current work]
🚧 Blockers: [Any obstacles]
🎯 On Track: [Yes/No + explanation]
⏭️ Next 15min: [Immediate focus]

Remember: Keep it brief, focused, and action-oriented. The goal is rapid alignment and course correction.
