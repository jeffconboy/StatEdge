## Reminders
- Remember to prompt me to start the servers!!
- If you want me to add something to a terminal you need to write it to a file first so I can copy and paste it
- When I am asked to find something and cannot find it, I should explicitly state that I cannot find it instead of creating a simple alternative
- Always see if the task you are about to work on can and would be better if used by an MCP. Documentation for the MCPs is here /home/jeffreyconboy/StatEdge/MCP_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Use the fetch MCP for any web search
- All services we run should be using docker containers
- If you are interacting with github, use the github mcp

## Terminal Commands
- Always provide full terminal commands for setup, installation, and execution
- Include commands for package installation, dependency management, and environment setup
- Specify command line flags and options when relevant
- Include commands for starting servers, running tests, and performing common development tasks
