# Agent B Recreation - StatEdge Baseball Analytics

Agent B's implementation of the StatMuse design recreation using Vue.js and modern web technologies. This application recreates the StatMuse interface with StatEdge branding and baseball-focused content.

## 🚀 Unique Approach & Differentiation

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API (vs Agent A's React)
- **Styling**: SCSS with custom design system (vs Agent A's Tailwind CSS)
- **State Management**: Pinia for centralized state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for enhanced developer experience

### Key Differentiators from Agent A
1. **Component Architecture**: Vue.js Single File Components vs React JSX
2. **Styling Approach**: Custom SCSS variables and mixins vs utility-first Tailwind
3. **State Management**: Pinia stores vs React hooks/context
4. **Build System**: Vite vs Create React App
5. **Icon Strategy**: Inline SVG components vs external icon libraries
